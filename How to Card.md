# Setting your samplers, prompt, and template
### A little bit of skipable theory...
In a nutshell, Large language models are extremely difficult math function of text order prediction.

**Samplers** or Generation settings are variables used to tweak aspect of generated text. For example, high temperature sampler makes text more creative yet incoherrent; low temperature makes text stable yet predicatable. 

**Prompt** is instruction the AI to respond a certain way. User can control:
* **System aka Pre-history prompt** to determine general congtext and writing style.
* **Jailbreak aka Post-history prompt** a command placed right after last message in the chat and has the strongest affect on the bot's responce.

**Prompt or instruction format** is special wrappings for messages in chat of bot and user. It's unnecessary, but helps AI to define message length and preven user impersonation.
